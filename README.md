# Trustworthy Multi-Fusion Architectures: Neuro-Symbolic Integration for Structured & Unstructured Reasoning in Agentic AI Systems for Healthcare & Finance.

# Paper Summary:
This research introduces TMFA, a next-generation neuro-symbolic and agentic AI framework tailored for high-stakes domains like healthcare (clinical trials, diagnostics, pharma analytics) and finance (fraud detection, insurance compliance, risk modeling)- where traditional deep learning and LLMs fail to deliver trust, reasoning depth, and auditability.

TMFA solves core limitations of current AI systems by fusing:

- Neuro-symbolic reasoning: Combines deep learningâ€™s pattern recognition with formal logic and ontologies (e.g., SNOMED-CT, XBRL) for consistent, explainable decisions.
- Autonomous agentic coordination: Multi-agent architecture (DSAs, coordination agents, MRAs) ensures modularity, domain specialization, and globally coherent reasoning.
- Cross-domain semantic alignment: Enables structured knowledge transfer between healthcare and finance through shared semantic graphs and reasoning bridges.
- Temporal and uncertainty-aware reasoning: Incorporates hierarchical memory systems and calibrated confidence estimation for decisions over evolving data.
- XAI (eXplainable AI): Produces multi-level, traceable justifications for every output- aligned with clinical, legal, and regulatory expectations.
- Regulatory compliance and fairness auditing: Embeds domain-specific rules (HIPAA, Basel III, MiFID II), bias mitigation, and federated explainability.

The TMFA achieved 94.7% accuracy on diagnostic tasks (MIMIC-III) and 97.2% precision in financial fraud detection (FinCEN), outperforming black-box LLMs and purely symbolic systems while maintaining transparency, adaptability, and trustworthiness. TMFA is a unified solution for AI deployment in real-world, regulated environments-bridging the gap between statistical learning and human-aligned, actionable reasoning.
