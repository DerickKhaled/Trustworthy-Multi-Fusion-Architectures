# Trustworthy Multi-Fusion Architectures: Neuro-Symbolic Integration for Structured & Unstructured Reasoning in Agentic AI Systems for Healthcare & Finance.

# Paper Summary:
We introduce the Trustworthy Multi-Fusion Architecture (TMFA)- a cutting-edge neuro-symbolic AI system that unifies deep learning, symbolic reasoning, and multi-agent coordination to meet the demands of safety-critical domains like healthcare and finance. TMFA features a hierarchical agentic framework, hybrid representation space, and mathematically grounded uncertainty quantification to deliver high performance with full explainability, compliance auditability, and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on MIMIC-III and FinCEN benchmarks, TMFA achieves 94.7% diagnostic accuracy and 97.2% fraud detection precision, setting a new standard for trustworthy, multi-modal, and regulation-aligned AI.
