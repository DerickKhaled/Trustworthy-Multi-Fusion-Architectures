# Trustworthy Multi-Fusion Architectures: Neuro-Symbolic Integration for Structured & Unstructured Reasoning in Agentic AI Systems for Healthcare & Finance.

# Paper Summary:
This research introduces TMFA, a next-generation neuro-symbolic and agentic AI framework tailored for high-stakes domains like healthcare (clinical trials, diagnostics, pharma analytics) and finance (fraud detection, insurance compliance, risk modeling)- where traditional deep learning and LLMs fail to deliver trust, reasoning depth, and auditability.

TMFA solves core limitations of current AI systems by fusing:

- Neuro-symbolic reasoning: Combines deep learning‚Äôs pattern recognition with formal logic and ontologies (e.g., SNOMED-CT, XBRL) for consistent, explainable decisions.
- Autonomous agentic coordination: Multi-agent architecture (DSAs, coordination agents, MRAs) ensures modularity, domain specialization, and globally coherent reasoning.
- Cross-domain semantic alignment: Enables structured knowledge transfer between healthcare and finance through shared semantic graphs and reasoning bridges.
- Temporal and uncertainty-aware reasoning: Incorporates hierarchical memory systems and calibrated confidence estimation for decisions over evolving data.
- XAI (eXplainable AI): Produces multi-level, traceable justifications for every output- aligned with clinical, legal, and regulatory expectations.
- Regulatory compliance and fairness auditing: Embeds domain-specific rules (HIPAA, Basel III, MiFID II), bias mitigation, and federated explainability.

The TMFA achieved 94.7% accuracy on diagnostic tasks (MIMIC-III) and 97.2% precision in financial fraud detection (FinCEN), outperforming black-box LLMs and purely symbolic systems while maintaining transparency, adaptability, and trustworthiness. TMFA is a unified solution for AI deployment in real-world, regulated environments-bridging the gap between statistical learning and human-aligned, actionable reasoning.

# Trustworthy Multi-Fusion Architectures for Autonomous LLM Systems

This paper introduces a modular multi-fusion framework that enhances large language model (LLM) systems with trustworthy decision-making capabilities. It achieves this by integrating multiple alignment modules, agentic control units, and context-sensitive memory within a coordinated reasoning pipeline. The architecture facilitates the fusion of task decomposition, planning, reflective evaluation, and autonomous control into a unified system, enabling robust autonomous behavior with interpretability and alignment guarantees.

## Problem
LLM-based autonomous systems often lack modularity, transparency, and coordination across reasoning components, leading to brittle, untrustworthy outputs and poor generalization in complex, multi-step tasks.

## Solution
The paper proposes a trustworthy multi-fusion architecture that fuses symbolic, neural, and reflective modules for alignment, memory, and control. It enables consistent planning, self-correction, and real-time alignment during agentic execution. Each module operates semi-independently while communicating via interpretable signals.

## Results
- Improved alignment consistency across tasks via multi-module feedback
- Enhanced agent performance in long-horizon scenarios with 34% fewer alignment failures
- Supports continual learning, reflection-based correction, and symbolic memory for more interpretable AI behavior
